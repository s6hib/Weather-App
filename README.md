# Weather App

This is a simple weather application that allows you to search for the current weather conditions of any city in the world. The application fetches data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays the temperature, weather description, humidity, pressure, sunrise, and sunset times. This is an extension of a project I did previously, that ultimately does the same thing except only in the terminal and I used Python. You can find that on my account as well.
